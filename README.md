## Description 
When traveling within the United States in 2020, I want to know what kind of terrible things are happening in my destination city. Then I can make an informed decisions regarding my personal safety, and decide if itâ€™s safe to travel there at all!

We wanted to create a website to show how dangerous the world is in 2020 and how to navigate the risks as a traveler

Our site would consist of an input field for destination city and state. Once the info is entered the following information will be returned:
    A 5 day weather forecast in case a hurricane is on the way
    The latest COVID-19 data 
    Number of new cases for the day
    Direction the data is trending
    Number of deaths
    Breaking local news stories to inform me of any current or impending disasters.
